In my first linear algebra course at Waterloo (MATH 136), a problem I often encountered in lectures was not understanding the content geometrically. The textbook was of little to no help, containing only a couple of 2D/3D graphs, which were hard to understand since they were on paper. 

That's why I decided to made a note-taking app for 136 students to take notes while having the ability to understand what you're actually learning from interactive 2D and 3D graphs. The app also supports LaTeX equations. 

Tech stack: Next.js, React.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, Flask.
