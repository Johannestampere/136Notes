Struggling to grasp the geometric intuition behind linear algebra concepts? Traditional textbooks often fall short with limited 2D/3D diagrams that are hard to interpret on paper. That's why I built a note-taking app specifically designed for linear algebra students that delivers intuitive visualization using interactive 2D/3D models and supports LaTeX. 

**Key features:**
- 2D graphs - _Matplotlib_
- Interactive, zoomable 3D graphs - _Three.js_
- Full LaTeX Support - _MathJax_
- Custom note-taking

Tech stack: Next.js, React.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, Flask.
