Struggling to grasp the geometric intuition behind linear algebra concepts in Waterloo's MATH 136? Traditional textbooks often fall short with limited 2D/3D diagrams that are hard to interpret on paper. That's why I built this note-taking app specifically designed for MATH 136 students.

*Key features:*
- Interactive 2D/3D Graphs
- Full LaTeX Support
- Custom note-taking

Tech stack: Next.js, React.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, Flask.
